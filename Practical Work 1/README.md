# Applying Neural Networks to a new dataset

**Goal**: Applying studied neural network techniques in class (keras) and applying it to a new dataset (titanic dataset). Also compare the obtained results with the use of [autokeras](https://github.com/keras-team/autokeras)

**Submission**: A jupyter notebook ".ipynb" explaining:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Training steps and optimization

Everything should be clearly documented
